    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Momos are cute little dumplings of Tibetan origin filled with either meat or veggies. Below we'll show you how to make them vegan! This recipe is fun, and it makes delicious appetizers. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients and Equipment:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Canola Oil</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Paneer</li>
        <li>Corn</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Corriander</li>
        <li>Dumpling sheets</li>
        <li>Bamboo steamer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>slice the cabbage into small shreds</li>
    <li>You can also add the vegetables to a food processor and quickly blitz them into small bits.</li>
    <li>Next, heat the oil in a skillet and add finely chopped onions, grated ginger, minced garlic, and sliced chillies</li>
    <li>Sizzle the ingredients for a few minutes or until the onion softens and turns translucent.</li>
    <li>Now, add the prepared carrots and cabbage to the skillet and stir-fry them over medium heat for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Then, tip in the turmeric, garam masala, chopped coriander, and cook for 3 more minutes. Season the veggie filling with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Keeping the wrapper in your hand, use your thumb and index finger to pinch the edges of the dough into a tiny crease (1).

        Continue pinching along the disc edges until you have something that looks like an open "tiny sachet bag". </li>
    <li>Finally, pinch and twist the opening of the "sachet" edges to seal the momo into a baozi-like dumpling</li>
    <li>Bring water to a boil in a large pot and then set up your steamer basket. You can line it with cabbage leaves or a sheet of parchment paper.

        Then, place the momos in the steamer, close the lid, and steam them for 15 minutes. The dumplings are ready when the dough wrapping looks translucent.</p>
    <li>Serve the vegan momos right away, dipping them in tomato chutney or chilli jam.</li>
    </ol>
